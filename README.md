# TODO List

-----

## What is it?

A simple TODO list add-on dock for the Godot game engine. On load, the it looks at all GDScript (.gd) files and scene file built-in scripts (.tscn, .scn, .xscn) for lines containing "TODO: " or "FIXME: " and displays them accordingly.

GDScript files can be double-clicked to open for editing. Built-in scripts require that the containing scene be open. I'd open them for you but EditorPlugin lacks the facilities to do so. :(
