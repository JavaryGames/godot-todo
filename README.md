# TODO List
A simple TODO list dock for the Godot game engine. On load, the it looks at all GDScript (.gd) files and scene file built-in scripts (.tscn, .scn, .xscn, .xml) for lines containing "TODO: " and displays them. GDScript files can be double-clicked to open for editing.

I'm afraid EditorPlugin lacks the facilities to open scene files for editing, so you'll have to trudge through that manually. :(
